# ZombieOrchard Agent Start

**Repository:** `LuminaryLabs-Publish/ZombieOrchard`

**Last aligned:** `2026-07-09T07-30-48-04-00`

## Purpose

This `.agent/` folder is the repo-local operating memory for scheduled and manual breakdown work on `ZombieOrchard`.

Read this folder before changing implementation code.

## Current selection result

The full accessible `LuminaryLabs-Publish` organization repo list was compared against tracked repo-ledger state in `LuminaryLabs-Dev/LuminaryLabs` and sampled root `.agent/START_HERE.md` state.

No checked non-Cavalry Publish repo was fully new, absent from the central ledger, recently added but undocumented, missing sampled root `.agent` state, or otherwise undocumented.

`LuminaryLabs-Publish/TheCavalryOfRome` remains excluded by standing rule.

`ZombieOrchard` was selected as the oldest eligible central-ledger fallback in the checked set. Central tracking still pointed to `2026-07-09T05-11-22-04-00`, while newer non-excluded repos had fresher alignment timestamps.

## Current product read

`ZombieOrchard` is a standalone static browser orchard survival/economy shell.

The current route is:

```txt
index.html
  -> src/boot.js
  -> src/start.js
  -> createOrchardGame()
  -> createWorldCanvas(document.querySelector("#world"))
  -> createHtmlInterfaceRenderer({ root: document.querySelector("#ui-root"), engine })
  -> requestAnimationFrame(draw)
```

The game has a playable baseline: Entry, Active Session, apple collection, pest clearing, day/night phase advance, Build, Market/Exchange shell, Roster, Inventory, Codex, Settings, and Outcome screens.

## Current interaction loop

```txt
open route
  -> src/boot.js imports src/start.js
  -> src/start.js creates engine, world-canvas renderer, HTML interface renderer, and frame loop
  -> src/game.js installs resource, pressure, orchard-world, construction, roster, inventory, generated interface, active-session, and interface-composition kits
  -> each animation frame calls engine.tick(1 / 60)
  -> tickable domains update pressure and active-session state
  -> engine.snapshot() aggregates every domain snapshot
  -> world-canvas renders trees, apples, pests, built objects, and player from snapshot
  -> html-interface-renderer renders active-session HUD or active interface screen
  -> data-action clicks route through interface-composition.activate
  -> data-command clicks route directly to active-session command handlers
  -> nested action.command can happen inside interface-composition
  -> nested command result is currently discarded
  -> interface-composition snapshot does not yet expose lastResult
  -> exchange screen currently renders as a generic interface screen
  -> window.GameHost exposes engine/getState/tick
```

## Target result/readback loop

```txt
exchange action row
  -> MarketActionCatalog
  -> MarketCommandSourceManifest
  -> MarketCommandEnvelope
  -> MarketSourceSnapshot before
  -> MarketPreflight
  -> MarketCommandResult
  -> accepted mutation or rejected no-mutation
  -> TransactionRecord if accepted
  -> MarketCommandJournal row
  -> MarketResultJournal row
  -> MarketSourceSnapshot after
  -> InterfaceNestedResultAdapter
  -> interface-composition snapshot.lastResult
  -> MarketResultProjection
  -> exchange renderer consumer
  -> MarketRenderReadback
  -> GameHost market diagnostics
  -> DOM-free fixture rows
```
